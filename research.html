  <h2>Research Interests</h2>

  <h3>Planet Formation in Protoplanetary Disks</h3>
  <p>
    My primary research goal is to understand how planets form within
    gaseous and dusty disks surrounding young stars. These disks set the
    initial conditions for planet formation and strongly influence the
    final properties of planetary systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Disk Evolution and Gas Dispersal</h3>
  <p>
    I study how gas is removed from disks through processes such as disk
    winds and photoevaporation. Gas dispersal determines the time available
    for giant planet formation and affects the migration and composition
    of forming planets.
  </p>

  <h3>Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Multi-wavelength observations of protoplanetary disks</li>
    <li>Theoretical modeling of disk physics</li>
    <li>Numerical simulations of disk winds and evolution</li>
  </ul>
