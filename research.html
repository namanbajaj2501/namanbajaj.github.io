    <h2>My Research</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Understanding How Planets Form and Survive</p>
    <p>
      Using JWST, I study the fundamental processes that shape protoplanetary disks—the birthplaces of planets. 
      My work answers critical questions: <strong>How do disks evolve? How do they disperse? And how do these 
      processes determine which planetary systems can form giant planets like Jupiter?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By directly imaging disk winds—both the MHD winds that drive evolution and the photoevaporative winds 
      that clear gas—we're witnessing the forces that shaped our own solar system 4.6 billion years ago, now 
      playing out in real-time around young stars across the galaxy.

            <h4>The Mystery of Disk Accretion</h4>
            <p>
              Picture a young star surrounded by a swirling disk of gas and dust—the birthplace of planets. 
              For this star to grow and for planets to form, material needs to spiral inward toward the star 
              in a process called <strong>accretion</strong>. But there's a problem: the laws of physics say 
              this shouldn't happen easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              For decades, astronomers believed that turbulence driven by the <strong>magnetorotational 
              instability (MRI)</strong> was the engine moving material inward. Think of it like a cosmic mixer, 
              stirring the disk and allowing gas to lose angular momentum and fall toward the star. But when 
              scientists looked closer—through observations and detailed computer simulations—they found a 
              troubling truth: MRI doesn't work well in most of the disk. The gas is too cold and weakly ionized 
              for magnetic fields to grip it effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              So if MRI can't do the job, what can? Enter <strong>magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds</strong>—
              magnetic fields that launch material <em>upward and outward</em> from the disk surface while 
              simultaneously allowing the remaining material to spiral inward. It's a beautiful cosmic paradox: 
              by throwing some material away, the disk can pull the rest inward.

            <h4>Seeing the Invisible: The Nested Structure of Disk Winds</h4>
            <p>
              Theory predicted that if MHD winds are real, they should have a distinctive "nested" structure—
              like Russian dolls, with different layers moving at different speeds and glowing in different 
              molecules. At the core, a fast, hot jet of ionized iron shoots outward. Surrounding it, slower 
              molecular hydrogen forms a hollow cone. And in some cases, even broader carbon monoxide emission 
              marks the outermost layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              But no telescope had ever directly <em>seen</em> this structure—until JWST. Working with 
              Dr. Ilaria Pascucci and an international team, we pointed JWST's NIRSpec instrument at four edge-on 
              protoplanetary disks in the Taurus star-forming region. What we saw was stunning.
            </p>

              <p class="image-caption">
                JWST/NIRSpec reveals the nested structure of disk winds in HH 30: a fast [Fe II] jet at the center, 
                surrounded by slower H₂ emission, with broader CO emission at the edges—exactly as theory predicted.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              In every single disk, we found the predicted nested structure. The fast iron jets, the hollow hydrogen 
              cones, the carbon monoxide layers—all there, all exactly where MHD wind models said they should be. 
              We measured where these winds launch from: between 1 and 10 astronomical units from the star, right in 
              the planet-forming zone.

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h5>What We Discovered</h5>
              <p>
                This was the <strong>first time anyone had directly imaged the layered structure of MHD disk winds</strong>. 
                It's not just one disk—it's all four we looked at, suggesting that MHD winds are common, perhaps even 
                universal, in protoplanetary disks. This fundamentally changes how we understand disk evolution and 
                the environments where planets form.

            <h4>Measuring the Flow: Jets, Accretion, and Hidden Companions</h4>
            <p>
              Seeing the winds was one thing. Understanding <em>how much</em> material they're moving was another. 
              In my first-author study, I analyzed the same JWST observations to measure the <strong>mass-loss rates</strong> 
              of these jets—essentially, how much gas is being ejected per year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using over 30 different forbidden emission lines—glowing signatures of shocked, ionized gas—I calculated 
              that these jets are losing about 10<sup>-9</sup> solar masses per year. That might sound tiny, but it's 
              perfectly consistent with the rule of thumb that jets carry away about 10% of the material being accreted. 
              Flip that around, and we can estimate the <strong>accretion rate</strong>: about 10<sup>-8</sup> solar masses 
              per year—typical for young stars in Taurus.
            </p>

            <div class="story-image">
              <img src="assets/images/bajaj2025-jets.jpg" alt="JWST jet mass-loss measurements">
              <p class="image-caption">
                Accretion rates estimated from jet mass-loss for four edge-on disks (red stars) compared to other disks 
                in Taurus. Our targets are typical—meaning MHD winds are common, not rare anomalies.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              But the jets revealed more than just mass loss. In one system, <strong>Tau 042021</strong>, I noticed 
              something odd: the jet was wiggling—oscillating side to side in a mirror-symmetric pattern. This wasn't 
              random. It was the signature of a <strong>hidden binary companion</strong>, pulling the jet-launching star 
              in a 2.5-year orbit. JWST had revealed a companion star that no one knew was there.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also found that the jets are intrinsically asymmetric—one side is brighter than the other, and it's 
              not because of dust blocking the light. It's something fundamental about how the jets are launched, a clue 
              we're still working to fully understand.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h5>Why This Matters</h5>
              <p>
                By measuring accretion and mass loss in edge-on disks���systems where traditional methods fail—we showed 
                that MHD winds aren't exotic outliers. They're operating in <strong>ordinary, typical disks</strong>. 
                This means MHD winds are likely a fundamental part of how all protoplanetary disks evolve.

            <p>
              Protoplanetary disks don't last forever. Within a few million years, the gas—the fuel for giant planet 
              formation—vanishes. Once the gas is gone, no more Jupiters or Saturns can form. Rocky planets can still 
              assemble from leftover dust, but the window for gas giants closes.

              Astronomers have long theorized that <strong>photoevaporative winds</strong>—driven by intense X-rays and 
              extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the central star—are responsible for clearing the gas. Imagine the 
              star as a cosmic hairdryer, heating the disk surface until gas molecules move fast enough to escape the 
              star's gravity entirely. The gas doesn't fall inward or get ejected by magnetic fields—it just... leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
              This process determines the fate of planetary systems. Clear the gas too early, and you get a system like 
              ours—rocky planets close in, maybe a few gas giants farther out. Clear it too late, and you might end up 
              with hot Jupiters or multiple giant planets. Photoevaporation sets the clock.
            </p>
            <p>
              But for 30 years, this was all theory. No one had ever <em>directly seen</em> a photoevaporative wind 
              clearing a disk—until my team used JWST to look at T Chamaeleontis.

            <h4>The First Image: Watching a Disk Evaporate</h4>
            <p>
              T Chamaeleontis (T Cha) is what we call a "transitional disk"—a disk with a large gap cleared of dust, 
              like a donut. We suspected this gap was carved by a photoevaporative wind, but we needed proof.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using JWST's MIRI instrument, which observes in the mid-infrared, I led observations targeting noble gas 
              emission lines—specifically neon and argon. These atoms are perfect tracers: they don't stick to dust, 
              they glow brightly when ionized by X-rays and UV light, and their emission patterns tell us exactly where 
              the wind is and what's powering it.

                The first direct image of a photoevaporative wind: JWST/MIRI reveals spatially extended [Ne II] emission

            </div>

            <p>
              What we saw was groundbreaking. The <strong>[Ne II] emission was spatially extended</strong>—it wasn't just 
              a point source at the star; it spread out across the disk. This was direct, visual proof that gas was being 
              launched from the disk surface and escaping into space.
            </p>
            <p>
              We detected four noble gas lines in total: [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ar II], and [Ar III]. The [Ar III] detection 
              was a first—<em>no one had ever seen that line in any protoplanetary disk before</em>. By comparing the ratios 
              of these lines, we determined that <strong>neon is ionized by X-rays, while argon is ionized by EUV photons</strong>. 
              The star's high-energy radiation is the engine driving the wind.

                This was the <strong>first spatially resolved detection of a photoevaporative disk wind</strong>. After 
                three decades of theory and indirect evidence, we finally <em>saw</em> it happening. T Cha's disk is being 
                cleared by radiation-driven winds, and we watched it in action.

            <h4>Understanding the Wind: Models Meet Reality</h4>
            <p>
              Seeing the wind was the first step. Understanding its physics required sophisticated modeling. Working with 
              Dr. Andrew Sellek and collaborators, we used hydrodynamic simulations combined with radiative transfer 
              calculations to interpret what we saw.
            </p>
            <p>
              The models revealed that the wind is <strong>dense</strong>—much denser than expected, with electron densities 
              around 10,000–100,000 particles per cubic centimeter. It launches from about <strong>1 AU from the star</strong> 
              and extends outward beyond 10 AU, matching the location of the dust gap.
            </p>

            <div class="story-image">

              <p class="image-caption">
                Hydrodynamic models of photoevaporative winds, combined with radiative transfer and synthetic JWST observations, 
                reproduce the observed noble gas emission and constrain the wind's density and launching region.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              The compact [Ar II] emission compared to the extended [Ne II] emission told us something critical: the wind 
              is so dense that it <strong>shields itself from soft X-rays</strong>, creating distinct ionization zones. Hard 
              X-rays penetrate deep and ionize neon everywhere, but softer photons are absorbed in the wind's outer layers, 
              ionizing argon only in specific regions.
            </p>
            <p>
              This shielding effect is a hallmark of <strong>thermal photoevaporation</strong>—the wind is driven by heating, 
              not magnetic fields. In T Cha's outer disk, at least, photoevaporation is the dominant clearing mechanism.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h5>From Detection to Understanding</h5>
              <p>
                By combining JWST observations with state-of-the-art models, we didn't just see the wind—we <strong>measured 
                its density, temperature, ionization state, and launching radius</strong>. This is the first detailed physical 
                characterization of a photoevaporative wind, giving us the tools to understand how disk gas is cleared and 
                how that impacts planet formation.

            <h4>Disks Around Double Stars: A New Frontier</h4>
            <p>
              Most stars aren't alone—many have binary companions, two stars orbiting each other. When a protoplanetary 
              disk surrounds <em>both</em> stars, we call it a <strong>circumbinary disk</strong>. These systems are 
              fascinating laboratories for planet formation because the gravitational dance of two stars creates unique 
              challenges and opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The orbiting binary carves a large gap in the inner disk, like a cosmic lawnmower clearing a path. This 
              affects how material accretes onto the stars, how winds are launched, and how planets can form. We've found 
              circumbinary planets—worlds orbiting both stars, like Tatooine from Star Wars—but we still don't fully 
              understand how they got there.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work on circumbinary disks is in its early stages, but the questions are compelling: How do MHD winds 
              behave when there are <em>two</em> stars stirring the magnetic field? Does photoevaporation work differently 
              when the radiation comes from two sources? And what does this mean for planet formation in these exotic systems?

            <h4>Early Results and Future Directions</h4>
            <p>
              Using JWST, I'm beginning to observe circumbinary disks with the same techniques we used for single-star 
              systems. The goal is to see if the nested structure of MHD winds and the signatures of photoevaporation 
              appear in these more complex environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preliminary observations suggest that circumbinary disks do launch winds, but the structure may be more 
              complex due to the binary's gravitational perturbations. In some systems, we see asymmetries—one side of 
              the disk may be brighter or more extended than the other, possibly due to the orbital motion of the stars.
            </p>

              <h5>The Next Chapter</h5>
              <p>
                This research is ongoing, and JWST is giving us the first detailed views of how circumbinary disks evolve. 
                Over the next few years, I'll be analyzing more systems, comparing them to single-star disks, and working 
                to understand how planets form in these dynamic, double-star environments. The story of circumbinary disk 
                evolution is just beginning—stay tuned for more discoveries.
